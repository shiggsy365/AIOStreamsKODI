## Overview

AIOStreams Kodi Addon is a feature-rich video plugin that integrates the [AIOStreams](https://github.com/Viren070/aiostreams) backend with Kodi's media center interface. It provides seamless access to streaming content with advanced features like Trakt synchronization, stream quality filtering, reliability tracking, and TMDBHelper integration for enhanced content discovery.

### What is AIOStreams?

[AIOStreams](https://github.com/Viren070/aiostreams) is a self-hosted streaming aggregator that:
- Scrapes content from multiple sources (torrent indexers, debrid services, etc.)
- Provides unified search across streaming providers
- Offers metadata integration via TMDb/TVDb
- Supports subtitle scraping
- Can be hosted locally or via services like ElfHosted

This Kodi addon acts as a frontend client to your AIOStreams backend, bringing all that functionality into your Kodi media center.
