## [3.1.0] - 2026-01-06

### MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENT - Seren's Next Up Approach

**ZERO API Calls for Next Up!** Adopted Seren's proven architecture for calculating next episodes.

#### What Changed
- Next Up now uses pure SQL calculation from local database
- Sync fetches ALL episodes for each show (not just watched ones)
- Next episode determined locally with zero API calls
- Instant loading, no rate limits, works offline

#### Performance Comparison
- Before: 69 API calls (cached 1 hour) + 3-5 second load time
- After: 0 API calls + instant loading (<1 second)

#### Technical Implementation
- Added air_date column to episodes table (auto-migrated)
- Sync calls /shows/{id}/seasons?extended=episodes to get all episodes
- New get_next_up_episodes() SQL query using CTEs
- Finds max watched episode, calculates next unwatched
- Filters specials, unaired episodes, hidden shows

#### Migration
- Automatic schema migration on first run
- First sync after upgrade populates all episodes (may take a few minutes)
- Fully backwards compatible

## [3.0.9] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **Performance Optimization**: Added 1-hour caching to show progress API calls
- **Reduced API Load**: Prevents making 69+ sequential API calls every time Next Up is opened
- **Smart Cache Invalidation**: Cache automatically cleared when marking episodes watched/unwatched

### Technical
- Added cache check in `get_show_progress_by_trakt_id()` with 1-hour TTL (max_age=3600)
- Cache key format: `show_progress_{show_trakt_id}`
- Added cache deletion in `mark_watched()` and `mark_unwatched()` for affected shows
- First Next Up load: Makes API calls and caches results
- Subsequent loads within 1 hour: Uses cached data (instant)
- After marking watched/unwatched: That show's cache cleared, fresh data fetched on next view

## [3.0.8] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **Next Up Now Working**: Fixed get_show_progress_by_trakt_id() to use API instead of database
- **Database Limitation**: Database only stores watched episodes, but Next Up needs all aired episodes to determine next unwatched
- **Progress Calculation**: API endpoint /shows/{id}/progress/watched provides complete progress with next_episode field

### Technical
- Simplified get_show_progress_by_trakt_id() to always use Trakt API
- Removed database-based progress building that couldn't determine next episode
- Database sync stores watched episodes for statistics but API used for Next Up feature
- This fixes the issue where 69 shows were found but none displayed (all filtered due to missing next_episode)

## [3.0.7] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL DATABASE BUG**: Fixed column name mismatch in Trakt sync preventing episodes from being synced
- **Next Up Empty**: Episodes weren't being inserted into database due to wrong column name (trakt_show_id vs show_trakt_id)
- **Schema Mismatch**: Sync code used `trakt_show_id` but database schema defined `show_trakt_id`

### Technical
- Fixed column names in `_sync_watched_episodes()` - changed `trakt_show_id` to `show_trakt_id`
- Fixed column names in `_sync_collected_episodes()` - changed `trakt_show_id` to `show_trakt_id`
- Fixed column names in `_update_all_show_statistics()` - changed all `trakt_show_id` references to `show_trakt_id`
- This was causing SQL errors: "table episodes has no column named trakt_show_id"
- After this fix, episodes will properly sync and Next Up will populate

## [3.0.6] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **Source Select Dialog**: Reverted to Kodi's built-in `Dialog().select()` for reliable display across all skins
- **Visual Bug**: Fixed issue where only title and labels were visible, but background and stream list weren't rendering

### Technical
- Removed custom WindowDialog implementation that wasn't rendering properly
- WindowDialog controls were partially visible but background ControlImage with empty texture failed to render
- Built-in Dialog().select() is simpler, more reliable, and works with all skins including Bingie

## [3.0.5] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed stale in-memory cache preventing Next Up list from loading after database rebuild
- **Database Rebuild**: Now properly clears in-memory caches before rebuilding database
- **Database Clear**: Added cache invalidation to prevent stale cached data

### Technical
- Added `trakt.invalidate_progress_cache()` call in `rebuild_trakt_database()` before clearing tables
- Added `trakt.invalidate_progress_cache()` call in `clear_trakt_database()` before clearing tables
- Ensures fresh data is fetched from API after database operations
- Fixes issue where empty batch cache persisted after bug that cleared Next Up list

## [3.0.4] - 2026-01-06

### Changed
- **Source Select Dialog**: Converted from WindowXMLDialog to programmatic WindowDialog
- **Universal Skin Compatibility**: Now works with ALL Kodi skins including Bingie and others
- **Simplified Architecture**: No longer requires skin-specific XML files or texture resources

### Technical
- Changed `SourceSelect` from `xbmcgui.WindowXMLDialog` to `xbmcgui.WindowDialog`
- All dialog controls (background, labels, list) now created programmatically in Python
- Removed dependency on `source_select.xml` skin file and `white.png` texture
- Simplified instantiation - no longer requires xml_file or resource_path parameters
- Cleaner fallback logic with improved error handling

## [3.0.3] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **Source Select Dialog**: Fixed white text with no background when custom window fails to load
- **Skin Compatibility**: Improved fallback detection for incompatible skins (e.g., Bingie)
- **User Experience**: Now properly uses Kodi's built-in select dialog when custom window unavailable

### Technical
- Added pre-check for skin file existence before attempting custom dialog
- Improved error handling to detect when custom window fails to render
- Better fallback logic that activates when dialog is cancelled or fails

## [3.0.2] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed Next Up list being completely cleared when marking any episode as watched
- **Database Queries**: Added seasons data to `get_all_show_progress()` database query
- **Cache Invalidation**: Now properly clears both progress caches when marking episodes watched/unwatched
- **Rollback Code**: Fixed incorrect column names in database rollback operations

### Technical
- `get_all_show_progress()` now includes seasons structure from database
- Mark watched/unwatched now invalidates batch cache in addition to individual cache
- Fixed `trakt_show_id` → `show_trakt_id` in rollback SQL statements

## [3.0.1] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **TV Show Watched/Unwatched**: Fixed episodes not showing watched indicators when browsing TV shows
- **Next Up List**: Fixed episodes not updating in Next Up list after marking as watched
- **Database Integration**: Ensured show entries exist in database before updating episodes (prevents lookup failures)
- **Cache Invalidation**: Simplified cache clearing - now just clears in-memory cache after watched status changes

### Changed
- **Removed Legacy Code**: Eliminated all legacy disk caching for show progress (~160 lines removed)
- **Database Queries**: All show progress functions now query SQLite database directly instead of making API calls
- **Simpler Architecture**: Database is now the single source of truth - no redundant caching layers

### Technical
- Refactored `get_show_progress_by_trakt_id()` to use database instead of API
- Refactored `get_all_show_progress()` to build from database query
- Removed `update_show_progress_incrementally()` function entirely
- Simplified `invalidate_progress_cache()` to only clear in-memory dicts

## [3.0.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **Complete SQLite Database Integration**: All Trakt catalogs (Watchlist, Continue Watching, Next Up, Progress, History, Collection) now use local SQLite database
